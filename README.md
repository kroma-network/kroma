## About Kroma

Kroma is the first universal stage 2 Layer 2 (L2) on Ethereum. Kroma has been developed based on Optimism Bedrock
architecture, and aims to be a universal ZK rollup. Currently, Kroma operates as an Optimistic rollup with ZK fault
proofs, utilizing a zkEVM based on Scroll. The goal of Kroma is to eventually transition to a ZK rollup once the
generation of ZK proofs becomes more cost-efficient and faster.

Kroma offers lower transactions fees compared to the Ethereum mainnet, with native Ethereum security and EVM
equivalence. Our roadmap to transition from Optimistic rollup to ZK rollup sets Kroma apart from other L2 networks.
Additionally, Kroma is advancing towards decentralization. As an initial step for this, Kroma has introduced a
permissionless validator and challenge system.
